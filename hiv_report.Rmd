# Descriptive Analysis

## Tabular analysis

Some characteristics of the `r nrow(data)` viruses from the CATNAP database are displayed
in the table below.

```{r, table1}
table_one <- readRDS(
  file = here::here("data/output/table_one.rds")
)
table_one
```

## Graphical analysis

Below we report a scatter plot of antibody resistance as a function of 
number of PNGs in the glycan shield. 

```{r, plot-data}
#| fig.align = "center",
#| out.width = "600px"
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here("data/output/scatterplot.png")
)
```

# Regression Analysis

## Primary model

```{r, fit-primary-model}
# Added this in
both_regression_tables_filename <- paste0( # saving an object called both_regression_tables_[name of cutpoint]
  "both_regression_tables_config_", # adding actual cutpoint here
  WHICH_CONFIG,
  ".rds"
)

both_regression_tables <- readRDS(
  file = here::here("data/output", both_regression_tables_filename)
)
both_regression_tables$primary
```

## Secondary model

In this analysis, we generated a binary outcome where level 1 of the outcome
means the antibody resistance score was greater than `r config_list$cutpoint`.
These results are based on logistic regression.

```{r, secondary-model}
both_regression_tables$secondary
```


## Tertiary model

In this analysis, we generated a binary outcome where level 1 of the outcome
means the antibody resistance score was greater than `r config_list$cutpoint`.
These results are based on probit regression.

```{r, tertiary-model}
both_regression_tables$tertiary
```
